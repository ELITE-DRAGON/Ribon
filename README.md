## üåê Overview

**Ribon** is a Python-based brute force tool that helps security professionals, penetration testers, and developers assess the strength of password-based authentication systems. With a focus on efficiency and flexibility, Ribon offers a way to simulate brute force attempts on login systems to identify potential security weaknesses. **Remember**: This tool is meant exclusively for ethical hacking and legal security testing purposes.

## üéØ Key Features

- **Automated Brute Force Testing**: Simulates real-world brute force attacks on login pages by sending multiple login requests with different password combinations.
- **Multithreaded Execution**: Utilizes multithreading to send requests concurrently, drastically increasing the speed and efficiency of the brute force process.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Allows users to specify target URL, username, and custom error messages to fine-tune the attack.
- **User-Friendly Command-Line Interface**: Interactive output displays the status of ongoing tests, including any successful logins detected.
- **Flexible and Configurable**: Easily customize request headers, proxies, and error handling for a variety of login configurations.

## üì• Installation Guide

Before you get started, make sure you have Python 3.7 or later installed on your system.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Start by cloning this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ELITE-DRAGON/Ribon.git
cd ribon
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies from `requirements.txt`:

bash

Copy code

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

> The `requirements.txt` file includes essential libraries such as `requests` and `threading` for handling HTTP requests and concurrent processes.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

To use Ribon, execute the `Ribon.py` script with the following command:

bash

Copy code

`python Ribon.py <URL> <USERNAME> <ERROR_MESSAGE>`

### Arguments

- **URL**: The URL of the target login page.
- **USERNAME**: The username for which you want to attempt login.
- **ERROR_MESSAGE**: The error message shown by the site when a login attempt fails.

### Example Command

bash

Copy code

`python Ribon.py http://example.com/login user123 "Invalid login"`

> In the example above, the tool will send login requests to `http://example.com/login`, attempting to log in with the username `user123` and checking each attempt's response to see if it contains the message `"Invalid login"`.

---

## üöÄ Advanced Usage

You can modify the script to add custom headers, proxies, or advanced error-handling logic by editing the `BruteForceCracker` class.

- **Custom Headers**: Add headers to mimic real user-agent requests.
- **Proxy Support**: Set up proxies to mask your IP during testing.
- **Adjustable Thread Count**: Customize thread count to manage network load.

## üõ† How It Works

Rioon operates by simulating a brute force attack, repeatedly attempting to log in using a combination of a given username and various passwords. Each attempt is analyzed to determine if the login was successful.

1. **Setup and Initialization**: Initializes the brute force tool with target URL, username, and error message.
2. **Multithreaded Execution**: Launches multiple threads to process login attempts concurrently.
3. **Response Evaluation**: Examines each response for the specified error message. If the error message is absent, Ribon assumes the login was successful.

## üß© Project Structure

The core of Ribon is organized for modularity and extensibility:

- `BruteForceCracker` class: Contains methods for setting up and executing the brute force attack.
- `crack` method: Performs login attempts, handling password lists and response analysis.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists required libraries, including `requests` for HTTP handling and `threading` for concurrency.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Legal Disclaimer

Ribon is strictly intended for authorized testing and research purposes. Unauthorized use, especially without the explicit permission of the system owner, is illegal and unethical. Ribon should only be used by individuals with explicit authorization for testing and vulnerability assessment. Misuse of this tool may lead to legal action.

> **Important**: Always comply with legal and ethical standards. Unauthorized access to systems can result in criminal charges.

## üîß Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues and solutions to help you use Ribon effectively:

| Error Message | Possible Cause | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError` | Network or site issue | Check the URL and network connection. |
| `KeyError` in `crack` method | Mismatched response key | Adjust error handling logic in `crack`. |
| `ModuleNotFoundError` | Missing library | Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. |

### Common Issues

- **Missing Dependencies**: Ensure you‚Äôve installed all necessary libraries from `requirements.txt`.
- **Incorrect URL Format**: Double-check the format of your URL; for instance, use `http://` or `https://` as appropriate.
- **Error Message Misalignment**: Verify that the error message provided matches the exact text returned by the login page for a failed attempt.
- **Network Issues**: If the script cannot reach the target site, verify network connectivity and ensure that the site is accessible.

---

## üß† Tips for Effective Testing

- **Limit Requests**: If testing in a production environment, add delays or reduce the number of threads to avoid triggering security mechanisms.
- **Start with Known Password Patterns**: Increase accuracy by using password lists tailored to known patterns or common passwords.
- **Run Tests at Off-Peak Hours**: Minimize impact on network performance and server load by testing during off-peak times.
